<h3>Overview:</h3>
World Politics since 1945is taught over two semesters.In the first semester, we will introduce the  major  theories  and  concepts  we  typically  use  to  study  world  politics.  Because  of  the complexity of world politics, we need assumptions (i.e., criteria for thinking about what and how to study world politics) to guide our study. In the first semester we shall explore different possible assumptions about world politicsand think how we can apply them to the empirical world. In the second semester, we shall first look at the history of major international political developments since 1945 and then examinefive crucial topics and debates about 21stcentury world politics.
