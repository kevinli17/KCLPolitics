<h1>Statistics for Political Science I</h1>

- Module: 4SSPP111 Statistics for Political Science I
- Date: 2021-2022 Semester 2
- Module Convenor: Dr. Adam William Chalmers

<h3>Overview:</h3>
This module is designed to provide students with analytical tools to analyse political phenomena. In particular, the module will focus on inferential statistics and the logic of regression analysis. The main goal is to train students in using particular quantitative techniques that can be useful to better understand the complexities behind the issues studied in political science. To achieve this, the module will focus on how to develop and test hypotheses using large datasets. 

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
At the end of the module, you will be able to:

- Know how to describe data.
- Understand how data is produced and how data is managed.
- Use different statistical inference techniques depending on different type of problems.
- Learn how test the relationship between two different variables. 
- Be confident with conducting basic statistical analysis with Stata.
